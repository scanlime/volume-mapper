Experimental Volume Mapper
--------------------------

Work in progress.. this was originally a test for Eclipse,
but I went a different direction with that project. Keeping this
for future work.

This is an attempt to create a low-res voxel map of average reflectivity of objects in space, using patterned LED light and one or more Kinect sensors.
